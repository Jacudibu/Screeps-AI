# Screeps-AI
My take on an AI for the programmer MMO Screeps (https://screeps.com/)

You can watch the AI in action over here: [https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/Jacudibu/](https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/Jacudibu/), although you might need an account in order to see everything.

### Current Status
I've pretty much stopped playing the game a couple years ago, and by now the AI has been eradicated from the map due to some code errors after an update.
See [TODO.md](../master/TODO.md) for things the AI still lacked whcih I eventually wanted to add, especially when it comes to autonomous long-term decision making and fighting.

#### Submodules
Right now we are using the following submodules:
* [ScreepsAutocomplete](../../../ScreepsAutocomplete) - For autocompletion in WebStorm.
* [ScreepsWarfare](../../../Screeps-Warfare) - Advanced Combat AI Module in a private repository.

#### Some other notes
If you are just looking for an AI to use on a public server, think twice - this is a game about programming, so you are kind of missing the point of the whole game by using someone else's code. And there are players out there who directly hunt such "non coding players", so you probably won't last too long.

Oh, and feel free to scavenge the code for errors & weaknesses to exploit if you are fighting against me, shouldn't be too hard to find them right now. ;)
