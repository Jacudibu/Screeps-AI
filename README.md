# Screeps-AI
My take on an AI for the programmer MMO Screeps (https://screeps.com/)

You can watch the AI in action over here: [https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/Jacudibu/](), although you might need an account in order to see everything.

### Current Status
The AI is still in development and lacks a whole lot of things (see [TODO.md](../master/TODO.md) for more on that), especially when it comes to autonomous long-term decision making and fighting.

#### Submodules
Right now we are using the following submodules:
* [ScreepsAutocomplete](../../../ScreepsAutocomplete) - For autocompletion in WebStorm.

#### Some other notes
If you are just looking for an AI to use on a public server, think twice - this is a game about programming, so you are kind of missing the point of the whole game by using someone else's code. And there are players out there who directly hunt such "non coding players", so you probably won't last too long.

Oh, and feel free to scavenge the code for errors & weaknesses to exploit if you are fighting against me, shouldn't be too hard to find them right now. ;)
