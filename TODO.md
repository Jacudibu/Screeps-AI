## TODO:

* AutoRespawn for Harvesters & Haulers
* rooms request haulers on certain energy threshold instead of having a hauler assigned (and idling) all the time
* Healers
* Group attack creeps into squads, sharing the same targets
* Harvest Minerals & Figure out Labs
* Optimize Tower Code - Have it repair ramparts below 1k hits and crippled creeps in general
* Automated scouts
* Optimizing RCL <= 2 harvesting
* Automagically adjust upgrader count depending on energy storage
* Calculate "Threat Level" when hostiles are in our room
* Automatic defense response depending on said level so we don't waste 100 ticks and 5000 energy to defeat a 1a1m creep
* Stalker Role - 1move creep which will attach to random enemy hauler/miner and ask them out, fleeing (and whining) as soon as some attacker enters the room


# Emoji talk:

* =^~^= when a hauler transfers energy to some other creep (the receiver makes the smiley)
* (ノ°Д°）ノ︵┻━┻ when a creep is fighting
