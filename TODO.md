## TODO:

* AutoRespawn for Harvesters & Haulers
* rooms request haulers on certain energy threshold instead of having a hauler assigned (and idling) all the time
* Healers
* Group attack creeps into squads, sharing the same targets
* Harvest Minerals & Figure out Labs
* Optimize Tower Code - Have it repair ramparts below 1k hits and crippled creeps in general
* Automated scouts
* Optimizing RCL <= 2 harvesting
* Automagically adjust upgrader count depending on energy storage


# Emoji talk:

* =^~^= when a hauler transfers energy to some other creep (the receiver makes the smiley)
* (ノ°Д°）ノ︵┻━┻ when a creep is fighting
