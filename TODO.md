## TODO:

* AutoRespawn for Harvesters & Haulers
* rooms request haulers on certain energy threshold instead of having a hauler assigned (and idling) all the time
* Healers
* Group attack creeps into squads, sharing the same targets
* Harvest Minerals & Figure out Labs



# Emoji talk:

* =^~^= when a hauler transfers energy to some other creep (the receiver makes the smiley)
* (ノ°Д°）ノ︵┻━┻ when a creep is fighting
